                    <p>BookNook was founded in 2025 with a simple mission: to help readers discover their next favorite book. We noticed that many bookstores and online platforms made it difficult to find books based on specific interests and genres.</p>
                    <p>Our solution was to create a bookstore with intuitive categorization and powerful filtering tools that make book discovery effortless and enjoyable.</p>

                    <h2>Our Team</h2>
